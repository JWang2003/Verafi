# Verafi

Verafi is an educational app on the subject of misinformation online. Verafi also features a built in fact checker to verify claims made online.

## Installation

Simply clone and open the project in Android Studio. Note that we used the Pixel 2 API 29 during development. Alignment may not be correct on other devices.

## Team

Created by team DogeCode of Richmond Secondary School for Season 4 of Game of Apps.

## Further development

Data is currently stored locally in JSON files, but can later be moved to a cloud database such as Firebase. Also note that the first page upon opening the app is laggy, our code could be optimized, but it works.
